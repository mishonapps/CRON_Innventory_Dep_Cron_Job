# Overview
This cronjob contains all the reports that are dependent on Latest inventory values, because new inventory values are pushed from SX to CA at 4 am 
Hence this cronjob also runs after 4 am. The following are the Data/Reports generated with this cron.

# Company-wide inventory Data
Here we take daily inventory from FTP server (companywideinventory). 

**Points to remember**
1) ND,CF and GA inventory Quantites are from SX, However Total Quantity(is not the sum of all the three quantites) instead it is from CA
DO NOT use Total Quantities for making oprational decisions
          
          What is the difference between SX and CA Quantites?
          SX Quantity = This the total on hand quantity (Doesn't matter if they are available to sell or not)
          CA Quantity = This is the total available quantity
          
The formatted data will be saved into the following table of mishondb.
